This is my first blog post.

Technologies used to build this blog:

- Apache httpd as a CGI webserver.
- Nushell for the CGI application logic.
- Pandoc for rendering markdown.

I probably shouldn't run this on the open internet though, because it feels like
this should have a full RCE vulnerability somwhere.
